# Behavioral Design Patterns

Behavioral design patterns are software design solutions focused on object communication, interaction, and responsibility distribution, making code flexible, reusable, and maintainable by defining common ways objects work together.

- **Communication**: They identify common communication patterns and realize them to increase flexibility.
- **Loose Coupling**: They reduce direct dependencies between objects, making the system easier to extend and maintain. 

This directory contains implementations of various behavioral design patterns in Python. Each pattern is demonstrated with a simple example to illustrate its usage and benefits.
